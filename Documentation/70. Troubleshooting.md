# Troubleshooting

## Memory limits

If you receive a message similar to the following...

> Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 268435456 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 8388616 bytes) in on line 48731

...it is likely that your environment does not have the resources available for autodiscovery of repositories and filters. It is possible to manually specify this configuration in your project's `ext_localconf.php` to bypass this functionality:

```php
$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXTENSIONS']['ll_anthology'] ??= [];

$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXTENSIONS']['ll_anthology']['repositories'] ??= [];
$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXTENSIONS']['ll_anthology']['repositories']['tx_myextension_domain_model_item'] = \Vendor\MyExtension\Domain\Repository\ItemRepository::class;

$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXTENSIONS']['ll_anthology']['filters'] ??= [];
$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXTENSIONS']['ll_anthology']['filters']['llanthology_category'] = \LiquidLight\Anthology\Domain\Filter\CategoryFilter::class;
$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXTENSIONS']['ll_anthology']['filters']['llanthology_date'] = \LiquidLight\Anthology\Domain\Filter\DateFilter::class;
$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXTENSIONS']['ll_anthology']['filters']['llanthology_search'] = \LiquidLight\Anthology\Domain\Filter\SearchFilter::class;
```

It is recommended to use the null coalescing assignment operator `??=` to ensure that previously loaded configuration is not overwritten.

While this will speed up using Anthology when the cache has not been warmed, the downside is that all repositories and filters must be manually specified, even the default filters supplied with the extension (as above).

**This configuration should only be added if there are issues with cache warming or memory exhaustion.**
